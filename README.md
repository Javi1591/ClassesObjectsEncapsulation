# Java Assignment 9 – Classes, Objects, and Encapsulation

A Java console application that demonstrates the use of **classes**, **objects**, and **encapsulation**.  
This assignment builds upon prior exercises to introduce object-oriented programming principles in Java, focusing on defining custom classes, creating objects, and managing data through fields and methods.

---

## Assignment Overview

### Description
The program defines one or more custom classes that represent real-world entities (for example, students, books, or bank accounts).  
Each class contains private instance variables, accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) methods, and one or more constructors.  
The main program creates and manipulates objects, demonstrating encapsulation and data abstraction.

### Features
- Defines a user-created class with private fields and public methods.  
- Demonstrates constructor overloading and object initialization.  
- Encapsulates data through getters and setters.  
- Displays object data through formatted console output.  
- May include basic validation to prevent invalid data entries.  

### Learning Objectives
- Understand class structure and member accessibility.  
- Implement encapsulation using private data fields.  
- Use constructors for object creation and initialization.  
- Apply the concept of object interaction through method calls.

### Files
- `Nazario_Assignment9.java` (example filename) — main driver program.  
- Additional supporting class file(s), such as `Student.java` or `Account.java`, depending on the assignment’s requirements.

## Program Structure
1. **Class Definition:** Contains fields, constructors, and accessor/mutator methods.  
2. **Object Creation:** Instantiates one or more objects in the main method.  
3. **Processing:** Calls methods to set, modify, or display object data.  
4. **Output:** Prints object attributes in a readable format to the console.
